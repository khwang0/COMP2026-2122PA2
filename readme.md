# COMP2026 Programming Assignment 2 - King Up!

## 2021-22 Semester 1

* Designed by: [Dr. Kevin Wang](mailto:kevinw@comp.hkbu.edu.hk)
* Q & A: [Piazza](https://piazza.com/class/kodsr5zs2km5ls)
* Due: TBD
* Download the starter code: [here]() 

## Introduction

You are given the opportunity to get familiar with the concept of class, object instantiation, methods, data attributes, and visibility. In this assignment we are building a board game called [King Up!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5c9dS001ac). This board game is simple to play and we will describe how the game works during the class. The details of how the game work can be founded in this link: [Rule of the Game](https://www.ultraboardgames.com/king-up/game-rules.php). You can also review the rules of the game from the following video links:
* [Cantonese Game Demo, Jolly Thinkers Boardgame Channel, Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tS5nZz6p4Y)
* [English Game Demo, Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5c9dS001ac)

## Changes of rule set in our assignments

We follow all rule described in the [Rule of the Game](https://www.ultraboardgames.com/king-up/game-rules.php) except we only play the game for one round.

We assume the game is played by one human player and three computer players. That means all decisions made by computer players (placing the character, moving the character and vote) will be done automatically while all decisions are all done by the user.

# Classes

You should started with the given skeleton code which can be downloaded here: 
* [Character](Character.java)
* [Gameboard](Gameboard.java)
* [Player](Player.java)

There are some descriptions for the classes and their methods that you are required to complete.

## Demo

A sample program can be found here (To be arranged). The sample program provides you an understanding of the program. You do not need to follow the exact wording and output format of the program. 

## Programming Style and Documentation 

Good programming style (indentation, comments…) is always essential.  Blank lines, spaces between operators/variables (wherever appropriate) and meaningful variable names are required.  You should use constants wherever possible.  Your program should be properly indented.  Good choice of variable names and method names is also essential.  Your program must have proper internal documentation, as described below: 
Header Block For your java file, there must be a header at the beginning of the file, with (1) a short description explaining the details of your program design; (2) your name; and (3) your UID. 

### Method Header Block 
For each method, there should be a header with (1) a brief description about what the method does and how it is achieved; (2) a brief note explaining the parameters of the method (if any); and (3) a brief note explaining the return value of the method (if applicable). 

### Inline Comments 
Wherever necessary and appropriate, you should add inline comments to explain the execution flow of your program. 

 

## Submission 
For submission, zip the src folder of your IntelliJ project, name the zip file as “XXXXXXXX_assign2.zip” (where XXXXXXXX is your Student ID number), and upload it to Moodle.  If you go for the bonus marks, you should also submit your short explanation inside this zip file. 

Please be reminded that both the **Late Penalty Rule** and the **Penalty for Plagiarism** are applied strictly to all submissions of this course (including this assignment).   


 

## Marking Scheme 
This assignment is worth 9% of the course mark.  There are three elements in the marking scheme: 
* 5% - Understanding the Assignment Test (UAT)
* 90% - a working program that functions as specified 
* 5% - Programming style and documentation 

Please note that submitting a program that cannot be compiled would result in very low mark. 

 

## Interview 
Should the teaching team see fit, students may be requested to attend an interview to explain about their program.  Students failing to attend such interview or to demonstrate a good understanding of their own program may result in mark deduction.
